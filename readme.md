#App description

    This App consists of two modules, a customer ordering interface and a manger interface console. The customer interface displays a table of available products to the 
    customer and allows them to place an order. If there is an insufficient quantity of the item ordered, the app will inform the user that there is not enough of thier desired product. 

    The manager portal has 4 main functions.
        1.  View listing of available  products
        2.  View those items with low inventory
        3.  Add to existing inventory
        4.  Add a new product to the catalouge
